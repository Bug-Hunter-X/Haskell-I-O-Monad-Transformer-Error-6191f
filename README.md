This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell when dealing with I/O actions within a monad. The `bug.hs` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.hs` provides the correct implementation using a suitable monad transformer (e.g., `MaybeT`, `EitherT`, or `IO`).  The issue arises when performing I/O operations within a monad without appropriate context management, leading to type errors.
